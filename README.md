# Simple-Peer-to-Peer-Transfer
A peer-2-peer file transfer system. User has the ability to register a file to a server, which stores the filename, IP address, and port number of the user. The other client can contact the server to learn the IP address of a filename, and immediately download it from the other user. Created for my Computer Networks class. Run this by initiating the ServerBroker class, and then the two ClientMain classes. ClientMain 1 uses port number 5001, and 2 uses 5002. ClientMain 1 uses txt files MobyDick and Reluctance. ClientMain 2 uses txt files alice and wordSmall.
